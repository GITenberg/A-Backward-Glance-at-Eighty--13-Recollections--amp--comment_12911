description: Charles Albert Murdock (1841-1928) left Massachusetts for California
  in 1855 with his mother, sister and brother. For many years he was editor of the
  Pacific Unitarian Magazine and one of the state's most distinguished printers. A
  backward glance at eighty (1921) begins with Murdock's memories of his trip west
  and reunion with his father, who had settled in Arcata on the Humboldt River. Murdock
  recalls life in the town and recounts stories of his father's early years on the
  Humboldt, the evolution of the region's Republican Party, acquaintance with Bret
  Harte, the printing business in San Francisco, 1867-1910, and the San Francisco
  Board of Education.
